Please consult amongst yourselves to determine the measurements you will make.

Then, get together and compare your results with each other. When you carry out the analysis as a group, think about if you can use statistics when you present the results. For example, can two pressure distributions taken by two different people but at the same angle of attack be averaged and then used for further analysis?

        "\n",
        "This section will provide you with the theoretical aspects required to understand the airfoil lab (or the infinite wing lab). The main objective of these experiments is to give you an insight into  two dimensional flow dynamics. First, we must define the operating environment and the operating conditions mainly to be able to create and assess the applicability of the assumptions framework. The operating environment is a low-speed open-loop wind tunnel with 100mm by 50mm cross section. The average temperature is approximately 20-25$^{\\circ}$C (you need to take a note of this from the thermometer) and the ambient pressure can be assumed as the standard sea level pressure. The operating conditions are represented by the wind tunnel's speed, which ranges from 10 to 40 m/s. There are two applicable assumptions that will be described separately: \\textit{inviscid flow} and \\textit{incompressible flow}. These two assumptions will greatly simplify our theoretical model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Inviscid flow\n",
        "\n",
        "There are no truly inviscid flows in nature as the phenomena of friction (viscosity), mass diffusion and thermal conduction always occur at a molecular level to a certain degree. However, in many engineering applications, these transport phenomena are mostly negligible, especially for high and finite Reynolds numbers flows. Therefore, the flow can be separated into two regions: the inviscid region and the viscous region. In the case of an aerofoil mounted in a flow at a low angle of attack, the viscous region is small and represented by the thin viscous boundary layer neighbouring the surface of the aerofoil. The inviscid region is represented by all the flow outside the boundary layer. **Given a wing chord $c=0.063m$, an upstream flow velocity $u=20 m/s$ and a kinematic viscosity $\\nu= 15.11\\times10^{-6} m^{2}/s$ ($Re=\\frac{u\\times c}{\\nu}$), how well is this assumption holding? Also, can the flow still be considered inviscid when the aerofoil is at high angles of attack at which separation occurs and hence a large wake is formed downstream?**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Incompressible flow\n",
        "\n",
        "An incompressible flow is defined as a flow for which the working fluid density $\\rho$ is constant. There are, of course, more advanced definitions of what compressibility is which link to thermodynamic considerations, but a good approximation is that all flows for which Mach number (M) is less than 0.3, can be considered incompressible. **Hence, what are your comments regarding the applicability of the incompressibility assumption for the current case?**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Bernoulli's Equation\n",
        "Using the assumptions of the inviscid and the incompressible flow, Bernoulli's equation becomes applicable. The equation is:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Irrotational flow\n",
        "If we consider an infinitesimal fluid element moving through the flow field, we can describe its orientation as a combination of both translation and rotation. Additionally, the fluid element may also change its shape, but this change can also be considered a combination of translation and rotation. The case on the right of Figure 1 shows on the upper streamline a fluid element where the angular velocities of its sides are zero, hence the flow is irrotational. The lower streamline of the case on the right shows a two dimensional fluid element where the angular velocities of the two intersecting sides are finite, but equal and opposite to each other and so their sum is identically zero; hence the flow is irrotational as well. **How well is this assumption holding for the current case? Explain only from a qualitative point of view**     \n",

        "For the airfoil, we will assume the static pressure farther away from the airfoil surface is $p_{\\infty}$ and this will be measured through the use of a manometer, where the pressure is proportional to the column height and the inclination angle of the manometer (FEEG1003 Thermofluids for revision on how to use a manometer). Here $h_s$ is the mm of water in the manometer corresponding to the pressure tapping, $h_\\infty$ is the mm of water for freestream static pressure and $h_0$ is the mm of water corresponding to the stagnation pressure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary thing to note here is that all pressures are in mm of water (since we use water as the fluid in the manometer). Therefore, to convert the mm of water to pressure in pascals, you need to use $p = 0.001*h\\rho_w g cos\\theta$, where the factor 0.001 converts mm of water to m of water, $\\rho_w$ is the density of water and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity and $\\theta$ is the angle made by the manometer to the vertical. It is important to note that $\\rho_w$ is not the same as $\\rho$. The $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid that flowing past the airfoil. In your case that is air and this density can be determined using ideal gas equation if you know the atmospheric pressure and the room temperature. $\\rho_w$ is the density of the fluid in the manometer and it is only relevant to convert the mm of fluid in the manometer in to a pascals. For everthing else you need to use $\\rho$.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you look at the above equation carefully, you will see that angle fo the manometer and the density of the fluid does not really matter to compute $C_p$. This is because they appear in all terms in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, they will cancel and the equation of $C_p$ can be written entirely in terms of mm of fluid in the manometer column.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experimental setup is fitted with a number of pressure tappings on both the top and bottom surfaces that are connected to a multi-manometer; this will allow you to measure the static pressures at points around the aerofoil. A standard pitot-static probe is mounted at the inlet to the contraction and the inlet of the test section to read the stagnation pressure as well as the freestream static pressure. The coefficients of pressure around the aerofoil can be determined using these readings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have the pressure coefficients you can integrate them to calcuate lift and drag. Note that the drag you will measure is only the pressure drag and would not include the viscous contribution.  \n",

These slopes allow us to resolve the forces along the geoemtry and perpendicular to the geometry. In the above, we have made a simplification that the curvature of the airfoil only affects tangential force and does not really change normal force.\n",

Note that lift is always perpendicular to the flow direction and the drag is always along the flow direction. We have obtained the normal and tangtial force coeffcients.

        "This theory predicts the following key points for aerofoils which respect the aforementioned requirements:\n",
        "* Lift coefficient is directly proportional with AoA and the proportionality parameter is $2\\pi$ (i.e. $\\frac{dC_{L}}{d\\alpha}=2\\pi$).\n",

        "\n",
        "where $\\alpha_{0}$ represents the angle of attack at zero lift and $\\alpha$ represents the geometric AoA. The value $2\\pi$ is the theoretical lift curve slope and in your experiment coudl give an answer slighty different than this. The value of $\\alpha_0$ represents the added effect of the camber on the coefficient of lift. For a symmetric aerofoil, the value of $\\alpha_0$ is 0. Furthermore, the value of $\\alpha_0$ can be either positive or negative, depending on a positive or negative camber, respectively. You are required to compare the experimental results with the theoretical expectations of the thin aerofoil theory.Refer to the lecture notes for further details about the theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there are uncertainties in the measurments including setting the zero angle of attack. If the lift for this airfoil is not zero at zero angle of attack, then that means there is an inherent uncertainty in the measurement. Morevoer, there is an uncertainty in carrying out numerical integration based on a fixed number of points. Both these will result in non-zero values of lift. This is acceptable and should be noted as an uncertainty. Therefore, it is likely that the measured lift curve slope different (most probably less) than theory.\n",
        "\n",
        " On a similar note, thin aerofoil theory neglects the viscous effects. In the actual flow, a boundary layer will form on the aerofoil surface which imparts additional drag through skin friction. At high angles of attack there may also be flow separation. These effects will also be dependent on the surface roughness of the aerofoil, since a rough surface can lead to an early transition to turbulence. Accounting for these effects would require more complicated CFD such as RANS which is not within the scope of this module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, comparison to XFOIL (which is similar to the theory) could have challenges. For example, XFOIL in inviscid mode does not capture any of above mentioned viscous effects. Moreover, depending on the number of panels used, you might get some answers at lower Reynolds numbers that are different to the theory. In XFOIL, it is possible to include viscous effects by setting a Reynolds number and transition points for the top and bottom surfaces. If you set a laminar boundary layer, the lift produced will be different form turbulent boundary layer. Given that the surface of the experimental airfoil is rough, it is resonable to set a transition point of 5% of the chord length (for both surfaces) in XFOIL since the roughness of the airfoil will most certainly trigger early transition. With this, XFOIL can use include turbulent viscous flow model in to the calculations. Further details of the transition process is covered in Part 3 Wing Aerodynamics, however, at this stage it is sufficient to say that including a turbulent boundary layer in to the XFOIL model could lead to comparable results to the experiments.\n",
